Clear memory and load files

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(scales)

```

I first input a [spreadsheet](https://perma.cc/VB99-T48E) from fishcount.org, providing estimates of the mean slaughter weight and mean lifespan of the 24 most commonly farmed finfish species.

```{r}
lifeexp <- 
  # Read file
  read_excel(
              "../1_input_data/fishcount_living.xlsx",
              range = "A9:V33") |>
  # Select collumns needed
          select(1,9:10,13:14) %>%
  # Convert collumn names to lower case
          mutate(across(1,str_to_lower))

# Rename collumns
names(lifeexp) <- c("species","weight_lower","weight_upper","lifespan_lower","lifespan_upper")

lifeexp
```

I then select the species I'm interested in (based on consumption in the EU).

```{r}

#Define search terms to filter collumns
species_list <- c("common carp","pangas","north african","trout",
                  "seabream","seabass","salmon","tilapia","striped") %>% 
                  paste(collapse="|")

# Filter collumns based on search terms
lifeexp %<>% filter(str_detect(species,species_list)) 

# Assign each species line to a species group
species_data<- lifeexp %>%
mutate(
  species_group=case_when(
    str_detect(species,"carp") ~ "Common Carp",
    str_detect(species,"salmon") ~ "Salmon",
    str_detect(species,"catfish") ~ "Freshwater Catfish",
    str_detect(species,"trout") ~ "Rainbow Trout",
    str_detect(species,"seabream") ~ "Gilthead Seabream",
    str_detect(species,"seabass") ~ "European Seabass",
    str_detect(species,"tilapia") ~ "Tilapia",
    TRUE ~ "ERROR"
  )
) %>%
  
# Order rows by species group
  relocate(species_group) %>%
  arrange(species_group) 
  
# Calculate upper/lower/average weights and lifespans across all species within a species group
species_data  %<>%
  group_by(species_group) %>%
  summarise(
    weight_lower=min(weight_lower),
    weight_upper=max(weight_upper),
    weight_av=(min(weight_lower)+max(weight_upper))/2,    
    lifespan_lower=min(lifespan_lower),
    lifespan_upper=max(lifespan_upper),
    lifespan_av=(min(lifespan_lower)+max(lifespan_upper))/2
  ) 

species_data
```

I then supplement the fishcount data with my own figures where I think I have better numbers in the EU context than those provided by fishcount.

-   (Small) Rainbow trout - Add in a median expected weight of 500g rather than the mid-point, given number of lives is likely to skew more heavily towards smaller weights given consumption is dominated by weight in countries consuming smaller trout. Used longer life expectancy based on [Jokumsen & Svendsen (2010)](https://perma.cc/T3NM-FKRL), [Animal Ask Denmark report](https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark), and [EUMOFA case study](https://perma.cc/G47F-CS6P).

-   (Large) Rainbow Trout - Used longer life expectancy based on [Animal Ask Denmark report](https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark) and [EUMOFA case study](https://perma.cc/XV5N-6B5R), and various websites suggesting around 1.5 years during on-growing phase to achieve harvest weight.

-   Atlantic Salmon - Used mean weight from [Norwegian Fish Health](https://perma.cc/FZF4-GYPU) report average slaughter weight and number of smolts put out to sea. Used life expectancy based on [Mowi Industry report](https://perma.cc/5BLM-5EB4).

-   Carp - Used data from [EUMOFA report](https://perma.cc/G9K7-WY3X) suggesting typical weights for consumption is 1.5 to 2kg, and typically 3 year production cycle. Small carp seem less commonly consumed in EU.

```{r}
species_data %<>%
  rbind(
   c("Rainbow Trout (small)",210,1200,500,12,15,13.5),
  c("Rainbow Trout (large)",1200,5000,3100,21,26,23.5),
  c("Atlantic Salmon",3614,8434,5663,22,40,31),
  c("Carp",1250,2250,1750,30,42,36)
  ) %>%
    mutate(across(2:7,as.double))

species_data
```

I now input data on apparent consumption of the most consumed farmed finfish species in the EU27 in 2021, taken from [supply balance sheet data from EUMOFA](https://eumofa.eu/supply-balance-sheet).

Splits between large and small rainbow trout are based on the [EUMOFA large trout case study](https://perma.cc/XV5N-6B5R).

```{r}

eu_consumption_2021 <- tibble(
# Define species names
  species_group=c('Atlantic Salmon',"Rainbow Trout",'Rainbow Trout (large)',"Rainbow Trout (small)",'Gilthead Seabream','European Seabass','Freshwater Catfish','Carp','Tilapia'),
# Add consupmtion in metric tonnes
  consumption=c(1097029,216425,94033,122392,136724,106776,102039,79726,39833)) %>%
# Convert to grammes (as fish weight reported in grammes)
  mutate(consumption=consumption*1E6)

eu_consumption_2021
```

I then add in the data with species specific data and work out number of animals slaughtered and age.

Note that my uncertainty ranges for lifespan will probably be too narrow, as I've assumed perfect correlation between slaughter weight and lifespan ranges (i.e. heaviest fish have longest lifespan, while lightest fish will have longest lifespan). Had I allowed for the opposite (lightest fish to be associated with longest lifespan), the ranges would have probably have been too wide.

```{r}

eu_consumption_2021 %<>%
# Add fish weight and lifespan data
  left_join(species_data,by="species_group") %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
# Number of fish slaughtered figures
    slaughter_upper=consumption/weight_lower,
    slaughter_lower=consumption/weight_upper,
    slaughter_midweight=consumption/weight_av,
# Lifespan ranges, assuming perfect correlation between weight and lifespan ranges
    lifeyears_1=consumption/weight_lower*lifespan_lower/12,
    lifeyears_2=consumption/weight_upper*lifespan_upper/12,
# Min and max lifespan
    lifeyears_lower=min(lifeyears_1,lifeyears_2),
    lifeyears_upper=max(lifeyears_1,lifeyears_2),
# Best guess of average lifespan
    lifeyears_midwl=slaughter_midweight*lifespan_av/12
  )


```
