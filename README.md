# [Github repository](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/farmfish_stunning_cea/): Farm fish stunning in Europe CEA

Sagar Shah, Rethink Priorities, February 2024

### About

This is the README file for the [Github Repository](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/farmfish_stunning_cea) containing data and code used in the publication: Prospective cost-effectiveness of farmed fish stunning corporate commitments in Europe.

Analysis was conducted in R and code was written in a mixture of R scripts (.R) and Quarto markdown (.qmd).

In order to edit and run the code, I suggest you download the [entire repository](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/farmfish_stunning_cea) to your local drive. Be sure to include the .Rproj file to ensure file references operate correctly.

### View rendered versions of script

For anyone interested in looking at the results in more detail, but not necessarily interested in downloading, editing and running the script, the rendered .html files are probably the best starting place. You can either download these files from the repository and open them locally on your machine. Or you can view them via the links below:

Note that most of these scripts rely heavily on functions and variables defined in three scripts ([a_functions](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/farmfish_stunning_cea/blob/main/2_code/a_functions.R), [b_fish_assumptions](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/farmfish_stunning_cea/blob/main/2_code/b_fish_assumptions.R), and [c_model_assumptions](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/farmfish_stunning_cea/blob/main/2_code/c_model_assumptions.R)) in the [2_code folder](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/farmfish_stunning_cea/tree/main/2_code).
